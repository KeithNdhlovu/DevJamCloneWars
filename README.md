# DevJam's The Clone Wars

Avuxeni, Sawubona, Dumela and Hello, I'm Keith, welcome to DevJam

This repo is going to be a companion to the DevJam Pod, so one can use this as one singular space to rule all my upcoming clone wars episodes to show progress.

Most of these projects will be simply UI, and will be built using the infinite multiplicity of JavaScript frameworks out there and this is coming from a developer who has been in bed with ReactJS for a while, this is one step closer for me to not become a "Frameworker" but simply a Software Engineer and be able to use any tool at my disposal to build cool Tech.

This should be a fun ride. Azishe ðŸ”¥
