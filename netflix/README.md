## Rules Of Engagement

1. We are not allowed to inspect the html elements to see the underlying styling and markup

2. Refer to rule #1

## UI Planning phase 1

1. We have 7 sections, the last section is a footer
    - The sections look like we could be able to create 2 components
    - Variant 1 -> would be a grid with two columns
    - Variant 2 -> would be one grid with one column 
2. We need to get the image assets
3. We need to workout the closest approximate fonts being used
4. We need create some kind of base design system "not really" but something close to that, IE the color schemes they use "this should be easy enough since Netflix looks like dark mode from day one"
